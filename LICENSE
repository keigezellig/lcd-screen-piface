* You can do anything with this program and its code, even use it to run a nuclear reactor (why should you)
* But I won't be responsible for possible damage and mishap, because i never tested it on a nuclear reactor (why should I..)
* If you think this program/code is absolutely great and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (or just plain useful), just
* let me know by sending me a nice email or postcard from your country of origin and leave this header in the code.
* Or better join my efforts to make this program even better :-)
